# Data-Science-Capstone-Project

## Executive Summary
This report summarizes methodologies and results from a data science project analyzing SpaceX launch data. The project involved collecting data from the SpaceX API and historical Falcon 9 launch records, followed by extensive data wrangling and exploratory analysis using tools like SQL, Pandas, Matplotlib, Folium, and Plotly Dash.

## Methodology
The project's methodology included:

## Collecting data via the SpaceX API and web scraping.
- Data wrangling and cleaning.
- Exploratory analysis using SQL and Pandas.
- Interactive visual analytics using Folium and Plotly Dash.
- Predictive analysis using classification models.
- Data Collection
- Data was collected from the SpaceX API and historical launch records of Falcon 9, converted to pandas DataFrames, and saved as CSV files.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
The project involved using SQL and Pandas for exploratory data analysis (EDA), including visualizations with Matplotlib and Seaborn to understand relationships in the data.

## Interactive Visual Analytics
Interactive maps and dashboards were created using Folium and Plotly Dash, highlighting launch sites and visualizing relationships between various parameters and launch success rates.

## Predictive Analysis
The project included a predictive analysis segment using classification models to predict launch success. It involved data standardization, training/testing split, and model accuracy assessment.

## Conclusion
In this project we concluded that specific launch sites and booster versions have higher success rates and highlighted the importance of strategic launch site selection.
